    <h3> A little bit about me...</h3>
    <p class="contentText">There are few things more satisfying than discovering that elusive solution to a complex problem. Equal parts logic,
      creativity and grit are all required. When they all come together, not only is the problem solved, but a lesson has
      been learned. Software development offers an opportunity to indulge in these types of puzzles and gain valuable lessons
      on a daily basis, all while building really cool stuff.</p>
    <p class="contentText">I love learning stuff and trying to master coding is a never ending pursuit. When I'm not trying to make computers do
      things, you can find me enjoying a craft beer (or several), drinking excessive amounts of coffee, reading books (most
      with superheroes), hiking and/or camping in the woods, attempting to cook food that taste good, listening to punk rock,
      listening to hip hop and soaking in Music City, USA.</p>

    <h3>Some Projects I've Worked On.</h3>
    <p class="projects">
      <h4 class="projTitle">DogFetcher</h4>
      <p class="contentText">A single page web application built to help users find rescue dogs in their local area. Using the PetFinder.com API,
        a random dog is displayed upon page load. The user is able to save the dog to their profile, view a listing of twenty
        five local shelters in the Nashville, TN area, as well as the complete listings for each shelter. Built with AngularJS,
        Sass, Bootstrap and Firebase. </p>
      <br>
      <h4 class="projTitle">BiblioFile</h4>
      <p class="contentText">BiblioFile is an MVC web app that allows uses to catalogue what’s on their bookshelf, both what has been read and what
        the user is planning on reading. The user’s collections are searchable and books can be added or removed at any time.
        User’s books can also be moved from the “To Read” section to the “Read” table. Built using C#/.NET, ASP.NET, SQLite
        and Bootstrap.</p>
