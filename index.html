    <h3> The Obligatory Bio.</h3>
    <p class="contentText">
      Making computers do stuff is fun. Learning how they do it is even better. Back in the day, I built Angelfire sites with my
      friends. We had no idea what we were doing, but we had fun. All these years later, writing code and building software
      is still just as fun, except now I actually know how to do it.</p>
    <p class="contentText">Originally from Boston, Massachusetts, I moved to Nashville after having my fill of New England winter in late 2011.
      Once I got here, I started working for an HR Consulting company. My interest in tech was ever present, and the idea
      of learning to code was always in the back of my mind. In late 2016 I found out about Nashville Software School and
      finally took the plunge and enrolled in April, 2017. After the intense six month course, I'm ready to take the next
      step become the best developer I can be. The best part is there's always going to be something new to learn. And I
      like learning stuff.</p>
    <p class="contentText">When I'm not writing code or learning a new aspect of programming, I'm usually reading a book, cooking, hiking, or playing
      with my dogs. I also like trying new craft beers, and I usually do this while engaged in another hobby. Its important
      to be able to multitask. </p>
